<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<p>Mechanics are the things that makes rocket league a cool and different game.</p>
<p>When im gonna talk about mechanics we need to talk around the besic first.
    The basic are shotting the ball in the goal, passing and saving. After the basic we learn much more and that can take more time but it is worth it.</p>
    <p>If you wanna learn the cool stuff like air dribble, pshyco, pinch, pogo, ground-, roof-pinch, flip reset and musty it wil take a realy long time to get to master all of them.</p>
</p>
<h2>Game sence</h2>
<p>Game sence is the best way to rank up fast or slow. When we talk about game sence we talk about when you wanna go for the goal when you wanna stop when you wanna go home every single desision you do is game sence. You and everyone you know can rank up to ssl by just doing every single desision right, if you dont have any mechanics that dosnt stop you from ranking up to gc1 at least its all about game sence.</p>
